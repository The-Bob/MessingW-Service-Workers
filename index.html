      <p>Once you've subscribed your user, you'd send their subscription to your
      server to store in a database so that when you want to send a message
      you can lookup the subscription and send a message to it.</p>
      <p>To simplify things for this code lab copy the following details
      into the <a href="https://web-push-codelab.glitch.me//">Push Companion
      Site</a> and it'll send a push message for you, using the application
      server keys on the site - so make sure they match.</p>
